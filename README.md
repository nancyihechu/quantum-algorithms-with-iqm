# quantum-algorithms-with-iqm
Implements key quantum algorithms—including Bernstein–Vazirani, QAOA for MaxCut, and Grover’s SAT search—using Qrisp and IQM hardware. Includes circuit optimization, real-device execution via Resonance, and clear, tutorial-style notebooks.
# IQM Quantum Algorithms – Notebook Implementations

This repository contains my implementations of key quantum algorithms completed during the **IQM Quantum School**. All work is developed and demonstrated using **Jupyter notebooks** (`.ipynb`) and executed using **Qrisp**, **iqm-qaoa**, **dimod**, and the **IQM Resonance** platform for hardware access.

The repository focuses on hands-on, hardware-aware demonstrations of:

- **Bernstein–Vazirani Algorithm**  
- **QAOA for MaxCut**  
- **Grover’s Algorithm for SAT problems**  
- **Circuit optimization & transpilation for IQM devices**  
- **Real hardware execution on IQM QPUs (Emerald / Garnet / Sirius)**
